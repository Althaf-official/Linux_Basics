### To check status

sudo systemctl status sample.service

### Update the [Service] section


Set the ExecStart to run the script /bin/bash /root/sample_script.sh.
Once done, start the service.

Run: sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/sample.service

Add /bin/bash /root/sample_script.sh to ExecStart

Save and Exit.

and then start the service: - sudo systemctl start sample.service

### Enable this service now so that it will be started automatically after a reboot for multi-user.target

sudo systemctl enable sample.service

### Now update the service to ensure that it restarts when stopped for any reason.


user Restart=always derivative.

Run: sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/sample.service

Add Restart=always to the Service section.



### Try and restart the service now.

sudo systemctl start sample.service or restart will fail.

Since you updated the service unit file, you need to reload it first.

Save and Exit


### How would you check the errors encountered earlier when the sample service did not have a valid service section?

journalctl -u sample.service
