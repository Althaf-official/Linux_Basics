### Which command is used to list all the cronjobs created for a user?

crontab -l

bob@caleston-lp10:~$ crontab --help
crontab: invalid option -- '-'
crontab: usage error: unrecognized option
usage:  crontab [-u user] file
        crontab [ -u user ] [ -i ] { -e | -l | -r }
                (default operation is replace, per 1003.2)
        -e      (edit user's crontab)
        -l      (list user's crontab)
        -r      (delete user's crontab)
        -i      (prompt before deleting user's crontab)

        
### How about now? How many cronjobs are scheduled for the root user ?

sudo crontab -l


### Inspect the cronjobs scheduled for bob again. Which command/script is run at 11 minutes past 11 PM every Tuesday?

Inspect the cronjobs scheduled.
The Day of the Week (5th column) should be Tuesday = 2

The hour(2nd column) should be 11 PM = 23

The minute (1st column) should be 11 minutes = 11

This transalates to 11 23 * * 2. The script that runs at this specific schedule is /usr/local/bin/system-identifier.sh

Bonus Hint: Use this handy site to predict a outcome of a Cron configuration:
https://cronjob.xyz/

`/usr/local/bin/system-identifier.sh`


### Schedule a cronjob to run the script /usr/local/bin/last-reboot.sh on the first day of every month at 6 AM

Use: Run `crontab -e`. This will open the crontab in the VI Editor. Add the below line to the file:

`0 6 1 * * /usr/local/bin/last-reboot.sh`

### When will the script /usr/local/bin/system-troubleshooter.sh be run?

The first column is 11 = 11th minute

The second column is 23 = 11 PM

The third column is * = every day in a month (1st to the last day of the month)

The fourth column is 2 = only the month of February

The fifth column is * = every day if the week (Monday to Sunday)

This means the script will run at 11 minutes past 11 PM on all days in the month of February

### The script /usr/local/bin/system-debugger.sh was incorrectly scheduled. It should run every half hour at minute 0 and minute 30
Use Step values for the minute column = */30 OR

Specify the minute column as 00,30 both of which mean at minute zero then minute 30.
To sum up, add this to the crontab:
*/30 * * * * /usr/local/bin/system-debugger.sh
