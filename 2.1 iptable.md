# Here is the simple architecture diagram of the implementation. This is a two-tier application.


The web server is hosted on devapp01.

The DB server is hosted on devdb01.

The Software Repository is hosted on caleston-repo-01.





Here are the connectivity requirements:

SSH should be allowed from Bob's laptop to both Web and DB servers.
HTTP/80 from the Web Server should be accessible from Bob's laptop.
The Web Server should be able to access the Software Repository server at port 80

### 1.Install iptables on devapp01 and devdb01 servers

Run: `sudo apt install iptables`

installed on devapp01?

installed on devdb01?

### 2 Are there any iptable rules created on either Web Server or DB Server right now?

Use the iptables -L command to list the rules.

### 3 On devapp01, add an incoming rule permitting SSH and HTTP connection from Bob's Laptop.


Bob's Laptop has an IP address of 172.16.238.187.

`sudo iptables -A INPUT  -p TCP -s 172.16.238.187 --dport 22 -j ACCEPT`

and 

`sudo iptables -A INPUT  -p TCP -s 172.16.238.187 --dport 80 -j ACCEPT`


Certainly! Let's break down the commands for you.

```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p TCP -s 172.16.238.187 --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
```

This command is using the `iptables` tool, which is a program used to configure the Linux kernel's firewall. Here's a breakdown of the components:

- `sudo`: This is a command that allows you to execute other commands with administrative privileges. It stands for "superuser do."

- `iptables`: This is the command-line tool for configuring the Linux kernel firewall.

- `-A INPUT`: This part of the command is telling `iptables` to append (`-A`) a rule to the INPUT chain. The INPUT chain is responsible for handling incoming traffic.

- `-p TCP`: This specifies the protocol to match, in this case, TCP. TCP is one of the main protocols used for communication on the Internet.

- `-s 172.16.238.187`: This indicates the source IP address (`-s` stands for source). In this case, it's set to allow traffic from the IP address 172.16.238.187.

- `--dport 22`: This specifies the destination port (`--dport` stands for destination port). It allows incoming traffic on port 22. Port 22 is commonly used for SSH (Secure Shell) connections.

- `-j ACCEPT`: If all the conditions specified before are met, this part of the command tells `iptables` to accept (`-j ACCEPT`) the incoming traffic.

Now, let's look at the second command:

```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p TCP -s 172.16.238.187 --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
```

This command is very similar to the first one, with the only difference being the destination port:

- `--dport 80`: This specifies the destination port as 80. Port 80 is the default port for HTTP, the protocol used for serving web pages.

So, in summary, these commands are configuring the firewall to allow incoming TCP traffic from the IP address 172.16.238.187 on ports 22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP).


### 4 Now, lockdown incoming traffic on devapp01. Drop incoming connections from any source on any destination port for any protocol (TCP/UDP).


Remember, this rule should be at the bottom of the chain for the SSH and HTTP access from caleston-lp10 to work.

`sudo iptables -A INPUT -j DROP`


Certainly! The command you've written is a command in Linux used to configure a firewall. Let's break it down:

1. **sudo**: This stands for "superuser do" and is used to execute commands with administrative privileges. It's often required for commands that make system-level changes.

2. **iptables**: This is a command-line utility for configuring the Linux kernel's Netfilter firewall. Netfilter is a framework that provides packet filtering, network address translation (NAT), and other packet mangling.

3. **-A INPUT**: This part of the command specifies the location where the new rule should be added. In this case, it's adding a rule to the "INPUT" chain. The INPUT chain is responsible for handling incoming packets.

4. **-j DROP**: This is the action part of the rule. It specifies what should be done with packets that match the criteria defined earlier. In this case, it's instructing the firewall to drop (i.e., discard and not process) the packets.

So, when you put it all together, the command is telling the firewall to add a rule to the INPUT chain that will drop all incoming packets. This effectively blocks all incoming network traffic, which is a very restrictive measure.

Keep in mind that using such a command without understanding the implications can lead to loss of network connectivity, and it's generally not recommended unless you have a specific reason for doing so and understand the potential consequences. Firewalls are important for security, but they should be configured carefully to avoid unintended disruptions. If you're experimenting with firewall rules, it's a good idea to do so in a controlled environment or with guidance from someone experienced in networking and security.


### 5 On devapp01, add an outgoing rule permitting access to port 5432 on devdb01 and HTTP access to caleston-repo-01. Once this is done, block outgoing traffic to any destination on http/https ports from devapp01


Note: caleston-repo-01 has the ip address of 172.16.238.15

`sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p TCP -d 172.16.238.11 --dport 5432 -j ACCEPT`

`sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p TCP -d 172.16.238.15 --dport 80 -j ACCEPT`

`sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j DROP`

`sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j DROP`

Sure, let's break down those commands for you:

1. `sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p TCP -d 172.16.238.11 --dport 5432 -j ACCEPT`

   - `sudo`: It stands for "superuser do" and is used to execute the following command with administrative privileges.
   - `iptables`: This is a command-line utility for configuring the Linux kernel's netfilter firewall.
   - `-A OUTPUT`: It appends a rule to the end of the OUTPUT chain, which is a set of rules that apply to outgoing network packets.
   - `-p TCP`: Specifies that the protocol being filtered is TCP (Transmission Control Protocol).
   - `-d 172.16.238.11`: Specifies the destination IP address as 172.16.238.11.
   - `--dport 5432`: Specifies the destination port as 5432.
   - `-j ACCEPT`: Specifies the action to take if the packet matches the rule, in this case, to accept the packet.

   So, this rule allows outgoing TCP packets to destination IP 172.16.238.11 on port 5432.

2. `sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p TCP -d 172.16.238.15 --dport 80 -j ACCEPT`

   - Similar to the first command, this rule allows outgoing TCP packets to destination IP 172.16.238.15 on port 80.

3. `sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j DROP`

   - This rule drops (blocks) outgoing TCP packets with a destination port of 80. Essentially, it prevents any outgoing web traffic on port 80.

4. `sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j DROP`

   - Similar to the previous command, this rule drops outgoing TCP packets with a destination port of 443. This effectively blocks outgoing traffic on the HTTPS port.

In summary, the first two rules allow specific outgoing connections to specific IP addresses and ports, while the last two rules block outgoing traffic on ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS). These rules, when combined, could be part of a strategy to control and secure outgoing network traffic. Keep in mind that understanding and configuring firewall rules require some knowledge of networking and security concepts. If you're unsure about these commands, it's always a good idea to consult with someone more experienced or study networking and security concepts further.



#### 6 Add an OUTPUT rule to the top of the chain which will allow https connection to google.com on devapp01

sudo iptables -I OUTPUT -p tcp -d google.com --dport 443 -j ACCEPT

Certainly! Let's break down the command for a better understanding:

1. **sudo:** This stands for "superuser do." It is used to execute a command with elevated privileges. The `sudo` command is often required when making changes to system configurations or files that regular users don't have permission to modify.

2. **iptables:** This is a command-line utility for configuring the Linux kernel firewall, which is known as Netfilter. It is used to set up, maintain, and inspect the tables of IP packet filter rules in the Linux kernel.

3. **-I OUTPUT:** This option is used to insert a new rule into the specified chain (in this case, the OUTPUT chain). The OUTPUT chain is responsible for filtering outgoing network packets.

4. **-p tcp:** This specifies the protocol for the rule, which in this case is TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). TCP is a common protocol used for transmitting data over networks.

5. **-d google.com:** This option is used to specify the destination IP address or domain name. In this case, it's set to "google.com," indicating that this rule is applied to outgoing packets with a destination address matching Google's servers.

6. **--dport 443:** This specifies the destination port. Port 443 is the default port for secure web communication using HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure). This rule allows outgoing TCP packets destined for port 443.

7. **-j ACCEPT:** This part of the command specifies the target of the rule. In this case, it's set to "ACCEPT," which means that if a packet matches all the specified conditions, it should be accepted and allowed to pass through the firewall.

In summary, the command `sudo iptables -I OUTPUT -p tcp -d google.com --dport 443 -j ACCEPT` is inserting a rule into the OUTPUT chain of the Linux kernel firewall. This rule allows outgoing TCP packets to Google's server on port 443 (HTTPS) to pass through without being blocked by the firewall.
