### Which port number does the SSH service use by default?


Bob's default password is caleston123


SSH makes use of port 22.

You can also validate this by running netstat -ntlp | grep ssh on a server running SSH service.

We learn more about netstat in the upcoming section.

Note: If you face any permission issues then make use of the sudo command.


### If you run ssh devapp01 in the terminal, which user are you using to connect to the server?


If unsure, try it out on the terminal.


If no user is specified with the ssh command, the connection will be attempted with the logged-in user which is bob


### Now, let's set up password-less ssh between Bob's laptop and the Dev Application server devapp01.


We will make use of bob's user account that has been created in the application server.

It uses the same default password: caleston123
#### First, generate the SSH key-pair using the ssh-keygen command in the caleston-lp10 server.


Key Type - RSA

Run: `ssh-keygen -t rsa`

Use all default options by keying in enter whenever prompted.

### The public key created using the previous command is:
SSH keys are created under .ssh directory under the home directory.

The public key has an extension of .pub

### Copy the public key to the target server devapp01.


Make use of the ssh-copy-id command

Run: ssh-copy-id bob@devapp01

### Which file on the target server is the public key copied in to?

The public key is added to the authorized_keys file under /home/bob/.ssh directory

### Finally, copy the file /home/bob/caleston-code.tar.gz from Bob's laptop to the server devapp01


Copy the file to Bob's home directory.

Run: `scp /home/bob/caleston-code.tar.gz devapp01:/home/bob`



Enter the password when prompted.
